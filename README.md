# A Nanofactory Roadmap 2:

## Improved Proposal for a Comprehensive Diamondoid Nanofactory Development Program

</div>

Objectives:
- Revise the motivations for molecular nanotechnology, redirect R&D resources away from alternative pathways to continuation of Moore’s Law.
- Outline the long, multi-phase development path on the experimental side.
  - Prove physical plausibility by shrinking the uncertainty in required parallelism and attainable reaction frequencies.
  - Highlight new technologies that will need to be developed proactively, to arrive just on schedule for the later development phases.
  - Take action to break the barrier to entry for Phase I.
- Outline the ambitions for a CAD software suite, which will lead to improved clarity on the more far-term development phases.
  - PyTorch for nanomachines. Importance of ergonomic API design and greater programmability, unlocking more control for the user. This often comes with negative effects on backend performance (CPU&ndash;GPU communication gap) and a higher barrier to entry (more extensive tutorial suite).
  - The need to restrict the software stack to Apple silicon and high-end Windows PCs (AVX2, discrete GPUs).
