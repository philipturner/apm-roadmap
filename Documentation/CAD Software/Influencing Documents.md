# CAD Software: Influencing Documents

[Silicon Carbide Build Sequences](../SiC%20Build%20Sequences/README.mdd) (Phase IV)
- Unexpected resolution of all major theoretical issues
- Occurred in the middle of an aggressive search for alternative materials (amorphous C, engineered proteins)
- Next steps postponed by the objective to make future code reproducible by other people. [Implementation Plan](./Implementation%20Plan.md) is the current evolution of that objective.

This document responds to [IMM rep058](http://www.imm.org/Reports/rep058.pdf) and accompanying reports.

[IMM rep061](http://www.imm.org/Reports/rep061.pdf) was published after the current document and the SiC build sequences.
